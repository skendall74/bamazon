# bamazon

In this activity, we were tasked with creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills.  The app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory. You can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

This uses MySQL and Inquirer npm packages and uses them for data input and storage.

Instructions:

Please download the App. Install NPM.  MySQL and Inquirer.  Run bamazonCustomer.js.
